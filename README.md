## Description

Hexlet Code is a collection of 5 math-related games designed to challenge and improve your arithmetic skills. The games include:

- Checking if a number is prime
- Inserting a number into an arithmetic progression
- Providing the result of a calculation (multiplication, addition, subtraction)
- Answering if a number is even
- Finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers

## Installation

To install the games, ensure you have Poetry installed on your machine, then run the following commands:

```
make install
```

## Games
# To start playing, you can run the following commands:

# To play "Check if a number is prime":
```
make brain-prime
```
# To insert a number into an arithmetic progression:
```
make brain-progression
```
# To provide the result of a calculation:
```
make brain-calc
```
# To answer if a number is even:
```
make brain-even
```
# To find the greatest common divisor of two numbers:
```
make brain-gcd
```
# After installing the package using pip install --user, all commands can be executed without poetry run (simply brain-calc, not poetry run brain-calc).
